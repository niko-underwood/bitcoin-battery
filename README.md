# Bitcoin Battery — Digital Energy Converter (v3)

**What's new in v3**
- The **battery** is now a giant Bitcoin battery with orange metal, glowing ₿ emblem, dual posts, and a live charge bar.
- The **left side** is a giant **melting ice cube**. As it melts, dollar bills fall out from the bottom and the visible stack shrinks. Move the dollars into the **Digital Energy Converter** and through the tube to the battery.
- The converter formerly labeled "MAIL" now reads **DIGITAL ENERGY CONVERTER**.

## How to run (local)
1. Download the ZIP and extract.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No server required.

## How to play
- Dollars spill from the melting ice cube; **drag** each dollar into the **Digital Energy Converter** slot.
- Each saved dollar becomes a ₿ coin, travels through the tube, and bounces around in the Bitcoin battery.
- Hover inside the battery to make coins dodge your cursor.
- HUD shows **Saved**, **Melted**, and **Streak**. Buttons for **Spawn Dollar** and **Reset**. Press **G** (optional if you bind it) to spawn.

Enjoy!
